#### **Summary**
After 10 years as a system administrator, I decided to change career. My choice was the transition to front-end development.
In July, 2019 I started htmlAcademy courses and half year ago I got to know about The Rolling Scopes School.
Unfortunately I didn't have time to enroll in courses in the 3rd quarter of 2019, that's why I joined RSSchool in 2020q1 and now filling this CV.
My main goal is to improve web-development skills.

#### **Skills**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript basics
- GitHub
